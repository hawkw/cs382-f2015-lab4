# CS382 Lab 4 - Hawk Weisman & KJ Sweet

What is it?
----------

Our sketch renders a small scene consisting of two randomly-generated trees (which are different each time), a sun, and a moon. 

The user can walk through the scene using the arrow keys, walking forwards and backwards using <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> and <kbd>&darr;</kbd>, and strafing left and right with <kbd>&larr;</kbd> and <kbd>&rarr;</kbd>. Moving the mouse changes the camera direction. The day/night cycle can be advanced by holding the <kbd>e</kbd> key or 'rewound' backwards using the <kbd>q</kbd> key, and the moon can be switched between a full moon and a new moon using the <kbd>w</kbd> key.

Who did what?
-------------

**Hawk Weisman** wrote the code for generating and drawing the tree, and helped out a bit with the keyboard input and camera position code.

**KJ Sweet** wrote most of the code for drawing the sun and moon, lighting the scene using the sun and moon, and handling user input.
